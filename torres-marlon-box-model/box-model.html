<p>Digital photography uses an array of electronic photodetectors to capture the image focused by the lens, as opposed
    to an exposure on photographic film. The captured image is then digitized and stored as a computer file ready for digital
    processing, viewing, digital publishing or printing.</p>

<p>Until the advent of such technology, photographs were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film, and used
    chemical photographic processing to develop and stabilize the image. By contrast, digital photographs can be displayed,
    printed, stored, manipulated, transmitted, and archived using digital and computer techniques, without chemical processing.</p>

<p>Digital photography is one of several forms of digital imaging. Digital images are also created by non-photographic
    equipment such as computer tomography scanners and radio telescopes. Digital images can also be made by scanning other photographic images.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The first recorded attempt at building a digital camera was in 1975 by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak.
    It used the then-new solid-state CCD image sensor chips developed by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1973.[3] The camera weighed
    8 pounds (3.6 kg), recorded black and white images to a cassette tape, had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels (10,000 pixels),
    and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in December 1975. The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production.</p>

<p>The first true digital camera that recorded images as a computerized file was likely the Fuji DS-1P of 1988, which recorded to a 16 MB
    internal memory card that used a battery to keep the data in memory. This camera was never marketed internationally,
    and has not been confirmed to have shipped even in Japan.</p>

<p>The first commercially available digital camera was the 1990 Dycam Model 1; it also sold as the Logitech Fotoman.
    It used a CCD image sensor, stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for downloading images.</p>

<p>The first flyby spacecraft image of Mars was taken from Mariner 4 on July 15, 1965 with a camera system designed by NASA/JPL.
    It used a video camera tube followed by a digitizer, rather than a mosaic of solid state sensor elements, so it was not
    what we usually define as a digital camera, but it produced a digital image that was stored on tape for later slow transmission back to earth.</p>

<h2 id="sensor">Sensors and storage</h2>

<p>The two main types of sensors are charge-coupled devices (CCD), in which the photocharge is shifted to a central charge-to-voltage converter,
    and CMOS or active pixel sensors. Nearly all digital cameras use built-in and/or removable solid state flash memory.
    Digital tapeless camcorders that double as a digital still cameras use flash memory, discs and internal hard drives.
    Certain 20th century digital cameras such as the Sony Mavica range used floppy disks and mini-CDs.</p>

<h2 id="multi">Multifunctionality and Connectivity</h2>

<p>Except for some linear array type of cameras at the highest-end and simple web cams at the lowest-end, a digital memory device
    (usually a memory card; floppy disks and CD-RWs are less common) is used for storing images, which may be transferred to a computer later.</p>

<p>Digital cameras can take pictures, and may also record sound and video. Some can be used as webcams, some can use the PictBridge
    standard to connect to a printer without using a computer, and some can display pictures directly on a television set. Similarly,
    many camcorders can take still photographs, and store them on videotape or on flash memorycards with the same functionality as digital cameras.</p>

<h2 id="metrics">Performance Metrics</h2>

<p>The quality of a digital image is a composite of various factors, many of which are similar to those of film cameras. Pixel count
    (typically listed in megapixels, millions of pixels) is only one of the major factors, though it is the most heavily marketed figure of merit.
    Digital camera manufacturers advertise this figure because consumers can use it to easily compare camera capabilities. It is not, however, the major
    factor in evaluating a digital camera for most applications. The processing system inside the camera that turns the raw data into a color-balanced
    and pleasing photograph is usually more critical, which is why some 4+ megapixel cameras perform better than higher-end cameras.</p>

<p>Resolution in pixels is not the only measure of image quality. A larger sensor with the same number of pixels generally produces a better image
    than a smaller one. One of the most important differences is an improvement in image noise. This is one of the advantages of digital SLR cameras,
    which have larger sensors than simpler cameras (so-called point and shoot cameras) of the same resolution.</p>
